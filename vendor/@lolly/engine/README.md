# `@lolly/engine`

The platform-agnostic core of Lolly. It loads a tool manifest, builds the input model from it, resolves asset references, runs the tool's hooks, hydrates the Handlebars template, and drives the export. Everything a render needs that is *not* a platform capability lives here, which is why the same tool produces the same output from the web PWA, the Tauri desktop and mobile shells, the CLI and the TUI.

The engine ships as source. `main` is `./src/index.ts` and there is no build step: Node runs the TypeScript directly via native type-stripping, Vite and esbuild handle it for the web shell. Its only runtime dependencies are `handlebars`, `ajv`, `fflate`, `yaml` and the workspace tool-author SDK `@lolly-tools/core`.

## The three-layer separation

```
engine/     ← this package. Knows nothing about brands, the DOM, storage or networking.
shells/     ← host implementations. Each provides a capability bridge the engine calls into.
community/  ← brand-agnostic tool definitions (manifest + template + hooks). Data, not code.
brands/     ← brand packs: tools and catalog content for one brand.
```

Two rules hold that separation up.

**Tools never import from the engine.** A tool is data: `tool.json`, `template.html`, optional `styles.css` and `hooks.js`. Hooks receive the host bridge and call `host.*`. That is what lets a tool ship without an app update and run unchanged on every shell.

**The engine never touches a platform.** No `document`, no `window`, no `fetch` at module scope, no filesystem, no storage. Anything platform-specific is injected at runtime by the shell through the bridge. Where a capability only some hosts can provide, it is gated by a `capabilities` flag in `tool.json` and the shells that cannot fulfil it expose a stub or an error.

The compiler only partly enforces this. [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json) sets `"lib": ["ES2023", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]`, and the comment there records why: `DOM` is present **only** for the fetch-spec globals that browsers and Node both have, meaning `Blob`, `Response`, `RequestInit` and `URL`, plus `URLSearchParams.entries()` iteration in `url-mode.ts`. It is not a licence to reach for a renderer. The no-`document` rule is enforced in review, not by the compiler, so a reviewer noticing `document.` or `window.` in a diff under `engine/src/` is the actual gate. `"types": []` keeps Node's typings out for the same reason, which is why co-located `*.test.ts` files are excluded from this project's typecheck and are typechecked by the root `tsconfig` instead.

## The `ENGINE_VERSION` contract

[`src/version.ts`](src/version.ts) exports `ENGINE_VERSION`, the HostV1 *contract* version: what level of the bridge this engine implements. Read the live value there rather than trusting a number quoted in prose anywhere, including in this file. It is deliberately decoupled from any product or release version, and `engine/package.json`'s `version` tracks it (`scripts/pack-engine.ts` asserts the two match before packing).

The policy is additive-only within v1, and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) has one entry per minor explaining what was added. Methods may be **added** in a minor version. They are never removed and never change signature without a major bump, and when v2 ships v1 must keep working.

This is not documentation-only. Since 1.53 `loadTool` enforces a manifest's `engineVersion` range against `ENGINE_VERSION` using `src/semver-range.ts`: a tool whose declared range excludes the running engine is refused rather than loaded. Widening the contract is therefore cheap and narrowing it breaks installed tools.

## Emoji

[The emoji guide](emoji.md) documents the whole feature: the pinned Unicode data
and pack resolver, the bounded static SVG subset, the deterministic brand
treatment, the pass the runtime runs over every rendered tree and every export,
the reserved `emoji` and `emojifx` params, the evidence behind each claim and
what is not built.

## The document API

[`src/document-api.ts`](src/document-api.ts) is the transport-neutral compiler
surface: `compile`, `validate`, `documentSchema`, `inspect`, `diff`, `measure`,
`optimize`, `package` and the shell-owned `render`. Its
`DOCUMENT_API_VERSION` is versioned independently from the HostV1 contract so
CLI, MCP, embeds and Lolly Work can agree on document shapes without inventing
their own adapters. Compile resolves typed inputs, token references and logical
assets without rasterising; inspect/diff/measure operate on that result.

[`src/asset-provider.ts`](src/asset-provider.ts) owns the
`provider://scope/path?option=value` grammar. Resolution remains a host
capability through optional `AssetsAPI.resolveProvider`: browser and CLI hosts
resolve local brand/catalog/library names, while `cms://` and `net://` are
available only where a governed hosted connector supplies them. The engine
never fetches a provider ref itself.

## The capability bridge

The canonical entry point for the v1 contract is [`packages/core/src/host-v1.ts`](../packages/core/src/host-v1.ts), a stable barrel over capability-sized declarations in `packages/core/src/host-v1/`. It is published as the tool-author SDK `@lolly-tools/core` so a third party can build tools against the exact interface without depending on the engine at all. `security/host-v1-api.json` snapshots every public declaration; `pnpm run check:host-v1-api` rejects accidental signature drift.

[`src/bridge/host-v1.ts`](src/bridge/host-v1.ts) is 17 lines and holds no types of its own. It is a header comment restating the two rules above, plus a single line:

```ts
export type * from '@lolly-tools/core/host-v1';
```

Engine and shell code keeps importing `HostV1` and its sub-types from that path unchanged, and the package exposes it as the `./bridge/v1` export. Edit the contract in `packages/core`, never here. `docs/host-api.md` is the prose guide to what the bridge offers a tool author.

## Security posture

Most of the module table below is parsers: C2PA, PDF, PPTX, ICC, X.509/DER, TIFF, WebP, MIDI, MOD, ZIP. They read bytes that arrived from somewhere untrusted, which makes them the engine's real attack surface. Two documents cover that surface and should be read before changing any of them:

- [`docs/threat-model.md`](../docs/threat-model.md): trust boundaries, what is assumed hostile, and what the engine promises.
- [`docs/parser-inventory.md`](../docs/parser-inventory.md): every byte-level parser, its entry point and its hardening state.

`tests/fuzz/` holds the fuzz harness: `targets.ts` declares one entry per fuzzed parser with a seed corpus of valid inputs built from the engine's own writers, `mutate.ts` and `prng.ts` drive deterministic mutation, and `tests/fuzz/regressions/` pins the cases that once failed. The Fuzzed column below is generated from those declared targets, so a parser showing `–` there has no fuzz coverage yet.

One more thing worth knowing before you read `runtime.ts`: hooks are loaded with `new Function('host', …)`, which is closure-scope injection and **not** a sandbox. Hook code still runs in the realm's global scope, so in a browser shell it can reach `window` and `document`. `host.*` is the intended path, not an enforced boundary, and third-party tool code is not safe to run until Worker isolation ships.

## How to find your way around

Eight modules are the engine proper. Read them in roughly this order:

| Module | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | The barrel, and the definition of the public surface. Shells import from here; tools never do. It is excluded from the table below because it is re-exports only. |
| `loader.ts` | Fetches and validates a tool, applies manifest i18n, enforces the `engineVersion` range. |
| `runtime.ts` | One mounted tool's lifecycle: load, build the input model, resolve assets, run `onInit`, hydrate, export. Owns the hook patch semantics and the `HOOK_BUDGET_MS` time-boxing. |
| `inputs.ts` | The single source of truth for input semantics. Shells render the model generically and never interpret manifest declarations themselves, which is how web, Tauri and CLI stay consistent. |
| `template.ts` | Handlebars hydration, the custom helpers, and `annotateTemplate` for mapping rendered nodes back to sidebar controls. Logic-less by design. |
| `validate.ts` | Manifest validation against `schemas/tool.schema.json`. |
| `url-mode.ts` | Every input expressed as URL params, plus the reserved param list. The CLI is this same path under a different transport, so GUI and CLI cannot drift. |
| `units.ts` | Physical-unit maths (`parseDimension`, `toPixels`, `toPoints`, `toCssLength`). The single source of truth each shell's export bridge applies per format. |

Everything else is a format or feature module, and the families are easier to navigate than the flat list suggests:

- **Provenance and trust**: `c2pa*.ts`, `seal.ts`, `contentseal.ts`, `trustmark.ts`, `x509.ts`, `der-read.ts`, `pixel-watermark.ts`, `watermark-search.ts`, `steganalysis.ts`, `file-metadata.ts`, `strip-metadata.ts`, `metadata.ts`.
- **Colour and gamut**: `color*.ts`, `css-color.ts`, `gamut*.ts`, `icc.ts`, `hdr.ts`, `bake.ts`, `image-cloud.ts`, `gradient-spec.ts`.
- **Brand and tokens**: `brand-*.ts`, `tokens.ts`, `design-map.ts`, `icon-theme.ts`, `photo-treatment.ts`.
- **Document and container formats**: `pdf*.ts`, `pptx*.ts`, `eps.ts`, `emf.ts`, `dxf.ts`, `tiff.ts`, `apng.ts`, `webp-anim.ts`, `zip-crypto.ts`, `media-sniff.ts`, `video-meta.ts`, `print-marks.ts`, `pdfx.ts`.
- **Geometry**: `geom/*.ts` with `geom-api.ts` as its façade, plus `svg-path.ts`, `svg-colors.ts`, `svg-custgeom.ts`, `css-box.ts`, `css-paint.ts`. See [Why the geometry is in-house](#why-the-geometry-is-in-house).
- **Audio**: `audio-analyse.ts`, `wav.ts`, `midi.ts`, `zzfxm.ts`, `zzfx-compose.ts`, `zzfxm-ref.ts`.
- **Plumbing**: `bytes.ts`, `batch.ts`, `compose.ts`, `tool-url.ts`, `url-pack.ts`, `embed.ts`, `lang.ts`, `fs-token.ts`, `session-record.ts`, `catalog-integrity.ts`, `data-import.ts`, `semver-range.ts`, `version.ts`.

## Why the geometry is in-house

`geom/*.ts` plus `geom-api.ts` is roughly 8,000 lines of Bézier geometry: booleans, offsetting, stroke outlining, curve intersection, spline lowering, cubic fitting. It is the one family in this engine with an obvious off-the-shelf answer for each job (paper.js, a Clipper2 port, bezier-js), so the reasons for writing it are recorded here rather than assumed.

- **The engine's dependency rule.** `engine/package.json` declares five runtime dependencies (`@lolly-tools/core`, `ajv`, `fflate`, `handlebars`, `yaml`) and no DOM library, framework or storage backend. `scripts/check-engine-purity.ts` enforces that by scanning: it fails on any `node:` builtin import, any DOM or storage global, and any import escaping `engine/src` other than the few it names one by one. A geometry package would have to go into `engine/package.json`, be granted an exception in that guard, and then run unchanged in a browser, in Node, and inside a Worker.
- **One kernel, attached verbatim by every shell.** `host.geom = makeGeomApi()` is the whole of what a shell does here: `shells/cli/src/bridge.ts` and `shells/web/src/bridge/index.ts` attach the same object, and `hook-worker-core.ts` co-locates `geom` in bucket A, constructing it inside the worker instead of proxying every call back over RPC. Being pure and dependency-free is what allows that copy. A shell-side library would mean a second implementation behind the same method names, and web/CLI/Tauri could then disagree.
- **The output is a coordinate, and it has to be the same coordinate everywhere.** `bezier.ts` keeps full cubic precision and returns parameters on the ORIGINAL curves; `intersect.ts` never flattens, samples or rasterises inside the geometry; `spline.ts`'s `hyperbezierCubics` places control points from the chord vector so the lowering is exactly equivariant under translation, rotation and uniform scale, to rounding. A polygon clipper decides regions on flattened input, which is the approximation those modules refuse. Pen shapes also travel inside share links, in the compact wire form of `geom/authored-url.ts`, so a design link opened a year later has to lower to the numbers it was saved with.
- **Two of the curve families are not cubic-library work.** `spline.ts` keeps an `AuthoredPath` (knots, handles, per-node continuity) and lowers one direction only, because a pen tool that stored cubics alone could not round-trip a knot. The curves it lowers come from Raph Levien's own sources, cited in the module headers: `spiro.ts` reproduces the Euler-spiral solver's formulae from the paper and from libspiro's `compute_ends` / `spiro_to_bpath` (upstream MIT OR Apache-2.0), and the `hyperbezier` default comes from spline-research. `fit.ts` determines each cubic by matching signed area and first x-moment in closed form, and measures Fréchet rather than Hausdorff error. A cubic-Bézier utility library replaces none of those three files.
- **Hardening is at the tool boundary, not in the kernel.** `geom-api.ts` validates a `d` string's grammar first (size, command vocabulary, argument arity, number syntax, coordinate magnitude) against exported ceilings - `MAX_CHARS`, `MAX_COMMANDS`, `MAX_CURVES`, `MAX_PATHS`, `MAX_NODES`, `MAX_COORD` - and returns a discriminated result rather than throwing, because a throw out of `onInit` is caught and discarded by the runtime. The parser upstream of it, `svg-path.ts`, carries its own ceilings in `docs/parser-inventory.md` and is fuzzed under the `svg-readers` target. The kernel itself has no fuzz target; its assurance is per-module tests (`tests/geom-*.test.ts`, `tests/spiro.test.ts`) plus the consumer suites `tests/design-path.test.ts`, `tests/path-stroke-pad.test.ts` and `tests/connector-geometry.test.ts`.
- **Licence posture.** The engine is MPL-2.0. `security/npm-licenses.json` records an exact-version licence for every locked package and feeds `scripts/build-sbom.ts`; none of paper.js, a Clipper2 port or bezier-js appears in it today, so each would be a new entry there, in the SBOM, and in the release audit.

None of this says those libraries are bad. It says a replacement has to clear the purity guard, produce identical coordinates in web, CLI, Tauri and the hook worker, and still leave `spline.ts`, `spiro.ts` and `fit.ts` in the tree.

## Module map

The table is generated. Run `node scripts/gen-engine-modules.ts` after adding, removing or renaming a module, and `node scripts/gen-engine-modules.ts --check` to fail on drift. Purpose comes from each file's leading doc comment, so the way to improve a row is to improve that comment.
