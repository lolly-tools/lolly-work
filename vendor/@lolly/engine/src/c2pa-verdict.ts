 *
 * Before this module each surface re-derived the verdict privately: the web
 * /valid view (shells/web/src/views/valid.ts resolveState/stateTone), the CLI
 * (`lolly validate`, shells/cli/src/validate.ts) and the MCP `lolly_verify`
 * tool (services/mcp/src/tools.ts) each had their own headline ladder and
 * their own expired-only check, and each assembled trust anchors by hand.
 * The three ladders had genuinely drifted (see resolveVerdict's notes on the
 * partsMadeWithLolly and 'trusted' tiers); this module makes the shared
 * semantics one function and the remaining divergence explicit at each
 * call site. Surfaces keep rendering their own words — resolveVerdict returns
 * a semantic state + the flags that drove it, never display strings.

/**
 * Resolve a verify report's flags into the ONE semantic verdict every surface
 * renders. Exactly the web /valid view's resolveState + stateTone semantics
 * (shells/web/src/views/valid.ts) — the reference ladder, replicated branch
 * for branch:
 *
 *  1. `madeWithLolly` wins outright — the question users actually ask. The
 *     engine only sets it on an intact credential (state 'valid'), so it can
 *     never paper over a broken file.
 *  2. `trusted && delivered` — CA-verified "official asset, delivered not
 *     created" (a c2pa.published action). Checked before plain trusted so the
 *     honest "delivered by, not made by" journey outranks the generic one.
 *  3. `trusted` — intact + the signing chain verified to a pinned anchor and
 *     the cert is still inside its window. `trusted` here is report.trusted
 *     RE-GATED on state === 'valid': defence in depth inherited from the web
 *     view — the engine only sets report.trusted on an intact file, but the
 *     resolver never trusts that invariant blind, so a (hypothetically)
 *     trusted-but-broken report still resolves to its failure state. This is
 *     a re-derivation of the engine invariant, not new logic.
 *  4. state 'invalid' + `likelyMadeWithLolly` — only the hard binding failed;
 *     the claim's own content (signature + every hashed-URI assertion) is
 *     verified and records a Lolly creation. The common re-save case; a
 *     softened 'warn', not a flat 'broken'. (The engine only sets the flag on
 *     invalid reports; the state gate is the same defence in depth as #3.)
 *  5. state 'invalid' + expired-only — bytes intact, cert lapsed. Softened to
 *     'expired'/'warn' because "modified after signing" would be a lie.
 *  6. Otherwise the raw report state passes through ('valid'/'invalid'/'none';
 *     anything unexpected degrades to 'none', as the web view's
 *     `STATE_COPY[report.state] ?? STATE_COPY.none` fallback does).
 *
 * `partsMadeWithLolly` (an intact chain recording Lolly steps under another
 * tool's active manifest) is deliberately NOT a rung: in the reference web
 * ladder it never drives the hero state (it surfaces as a scorecard pip
 * only), so a parts file resolves to 'valid' — or 'trusted' when anchored.
 * KNOWN SURFACE DIVERGENCE, preserved as-is and flagged in
 * plans/archive/maintainability-2026-07-18.md: the CLI elevates the parts flag to its
 * headline (after likely, before expired — so its trusted+parts cell reads
 * "Parts made with Lolly" where the web reads "Verified"), while MCP has no
 * parts headline at all. Both keep their behaviour by layering the returned
 * `partsMadeWithLolly` flag (or ignoring it) over `state`.
 *
 * Pure and display-free: returns the semantic state, its tone, and the flags
 * that drove it. Each surface maps those to its own words.

 * (plans/73-cli-ga-contract.md §12 O1, decided by Andy 2026-08-01): every surface
 * that answers "is this verified?" pins the same roots, so one word means one
 * thing everywhere.
 *   • web /valid           → { includeLollyRoot: true }
 *   • CLI `lolly validate` → { includeLollyRoot: true, extra: --trust-anchor PEMs }

 *       { includeLollyRoot: false, includeVendored: false } so the ONLY trust is
 *       what the caller pinned (none at all is a legitimate, documented answer).
 *   • TUI verify panel     → { includeLollyRoot: true, extra: pinned PEMs }
 *   • MCP `lolly_verify`   → { includeLollyRoot: true }
 *

 * throws (matching the CLI's previous inline pemToDer behaviour). The vendored
 * cache is never mutated — a fresh array is returned each call.

 * which is the bare-trust check: with no `extra` it returns an EMPTY anchor set,
