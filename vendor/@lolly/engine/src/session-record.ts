/**
 * Saved-session record envelope - the version stamps a shell's state bridge
 * writes for one saved tool session, and the migrate-or-warn branch it runs on
 * load.
 *
 * A session record (IndexedDB row on web, `$APPDATA/Lolly/saved-state/<slot>.json`
 * on the Tauri shells) is:
 *
 *   { slot, toolId, toolVersion, label, data, thumb, updatedAt,
 *     formatVersion, engineVersion }
 *
 * `formatVersion` is the record LAYOUT version (bump on any change to the fields
 * or their shape). `engineVersion` is the running engine that wrote it - a
 * breadcrumb for a future migration that needs to know which engine's data
 * conventions produced the record. The engine owns both the constant and the
 * migrate-or-warn branch so the three bridges (web + desktop + mobile) cannot
 * drift - the same discipline data-transfer.ts applies to the portable-backup
 * envelope, applied here to the per-session record.
 *
 * This is the hook the state.ts header always promised ("the runtime can decide
 * whether to migrate or warn the user") but never had: records written before
 * this shipped carry no `formatVersion`, so migrateSessionRecord treats a
 * missing one as version 0. The v0→v1 step is a no-op on the data (v1 only ADDED
 * the stamps), but the branch now EXISTS, so a genuinely breaking 1.1 change has
 * somewhere to stand instead of guessing at every unversioned file forever.
