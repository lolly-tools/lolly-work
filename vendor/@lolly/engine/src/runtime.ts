 * Runtime - orchestrates the 5-step lifecycle for a single mounted tool.
 *
 *   1. Request tool & template      → loader.ts (done before runtime exists)
 *   2. Present inputs               → buildInputModel + host UI
 *   3. Hydrate template             → hydrate()
 *   4. Stage for render             → host configures the render target
 *   5. Render to format             → host.export.render()
 *
 * The runtime is platform-agnostic. It receives a host (the capability bridge)
 * and emits state updates. The shell renders them.
 *
 * Hooks (if the tool declares any) are loaded via `new Function` with the host
 * bridge injected as closure scope - a portability contract, NOT a security
 * boundary (see getHookFactory). The runtime invokes them at the right
 * lifecycle points, time-boxes their async results (HOOK_BUDGET_MS), and
 * merges their effects.
 *
 * Patch semantics:
 *   Hooks return a plain object. Keys that match a declared input id update
 *   that input's value. Keys with no matching input go into `extras` - a
 *   parallel store of hook-computed values the template can reference directly.
 *   This is how QR module lists, chart data, etc. reach the template without
 *   being declared as user-facing inputs in the manifest.

     * input - version skew between peers - or one whose value the constraints
     * reject is DROPPED on its own; the rest of the batch still applies and
     * nothing throws mid-apply (section 11.11).
     *
     * What "reject" covers is exactly what the input model can decide from the
     * MANIFEST (see constrain in inputs.ts): a select value outside its declared
     * options, a non-boolean boolean, NaN/out-of-range numbers, an over-long
     * string, a non-array `blocks`, a malformed table/vector/file. It does NOT
     * type-check `asset` or `color`, whose legitimate values are object-shaped and
     * completed later in the lifecycle - a caller taking values from an untrusted
     * peer gates those at its own boundary (the web shell's collab plumbing does).
     * Nor is it a size/depth cap on hostile payloads: that is inbound-transport
     * hardening (section 11.21, wave 2.4), which belongs where the bytes arrive.
     *
     * `onInput` runs per CHANGED id, sequentially in the object's insertion
     * order, under setInput's time-box and warn-don't-throw handling: the hook
     * contract is per-input and must not change meaning just because the values
     * arrived together. Only the RENDER coalesces - one emit after the last
     * hook instead of one per key (a batch where nothing landed emits nothing).
     * Each hook is told the value that actually entered the model (post-constrain,
     * flattened), captured at apply time so an earlier hook's patch can't change
     * what a later id reports. One deliberate divergence from setInput, which
     * hands its hook the caller's RAW argument: a batch arrives from a peer, a URL
     * or `/multi`, where "what the user typed" has no meaning and the model value
     * is the honest one. A hook that branches on out-of-range input sees it on the
