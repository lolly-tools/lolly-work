/**
 * Boolean operations on regions bounded by cubic Béziers - union, intersection,
 * difference, exclusive-or - and the winding-number test they are all decided by.
 *
 * ## The method
 *
 * 1. Each operand is resolved against itself first (`selfUnion`). That leaves a
 *    canonical path: contours that neither overlap nor self-cross, oriented so the
 *    filled region lies to the LEFT of the direction of travel. Everything downstream
 *    may assume it, which is what removes most of the case analysis.
 * 2. Every curve of A is split at its intersections with B and vice versa, with
 *    `subCubic`, so each piece is still exactly the original curve over a sub-range
 *    rather than an approximation of it. No polyline is ever built.
 * 3. Each piece is decided by what is filled immediately to its LEFT and to its RIGHT.
 *    It belongs to the result exactly when those two answers differ - that is the
 *    definition of a boundary - and it is emitted pointing so the kept side is on the
 *    left.
 * 4. The survivors are chained back into closed loops by shared endpoints.
 *
 * ## Why both sides, rather than "is the midpoint inside the other path"
 *
 * A one-sided test needs a point strictly inside the region beside the piece, and the
 * only way to name one is to step off the curve by some epsilon - a guess that fails on
 * thin geometry and on any piece shorter than the guess. Both sides can be had exactly
 * instead. Cast a ray from the piece's midpoint M: every curve that does NOT pass
 * through M contributes an unambiguous crossing, and the curves that DO pass through M
 * (the piece's own, plus any coincident copy) contribute to one side and not to the
 * other, decided by the sign of the ray direction crossed with the tangent. One cast
 * therefore yields the winding on both sides of M without any point being nudged.
 *
 * The same fact is why tangency is harmless. A curve that touches another without
 * crossing it is split at the contact, and each resulting piece is decided at its own
 * midpoint, nowhere near that contact. The winding is never evaluated where it is
 * ambiguous, so a touch cannot toggle it.
 *
 * ## Where two boundaries coincide
 *
 * Shared boundary is the case that quietly breaks implementations of this, because
 * there is no isolated crossing to find and an intersector asked for one answers with
 * a scatter of points along the shared run. It is handled in two places and neither is
 * optional: `pairSplits` recognises the overlap before splitting and cuts both curves
 * at the true ends of the run, so the pieces line up; `dedupeEdges` then decides the
 * shared piece once, by whether the two survivors run the same way.
 *
 * ## Orientation convention
 *
 * Positive `contourArea` is counter-clockwise in a y-up frame, and a counter-clockwise
 * outer contour has its interior on the LEFT. Every edge this module emits is oriented
 * that way, so an outer boundary comes out counter-clockwise and a hole clockwise. The
 * rule is frame-agnostic: feed it y-down SVG coordinates and every sign mirrors
 * together, so the results stay correct and simply read as clockwise on screen.
 *
 * ## Bounded work
 *
 * Untrusted path data is ordinary input here (an imported SVG, a pasted glyph), so
 * splitting, projection, contact search and ray casting are all metered against one budget.
 * An operation that exhausts it ABANDONS the result, because a partial classification is
 * worse than no attempt: the edges past the cap are answered "outside everything" and the
 * walk chains that into confetti. The budget sits above what a legitimately large path
 * costs (measured: a stroked 400-curve wiggle spends a quarter of it), so exhausting it
 * means the input really is pathological.
 *
 * What it abandons TO is the part that has to be honest. A union can be handed back exactly:
 * both operands are canonical and interior-left, so concatenating them adds their windings
 * and the nonzero region really is A∪B. No other operator has such an alternative, and
 * substituting the answer a disjoint pair would give is not a degradation but a wrong
 * answer wearing a successful one's clothes - a difference silently returns the whole first
 * operand, an intersection silently returns nothing, and the caller has no way to tell. So
 * those three throw `GeomLimitError` instead. `selfUnion` is the exception and hands back
 * the unresolved path, which is a real approximation of its own answer: the input already
 * fills nearly the region its resolved form would under the nonzero rule.
 *
 * What the budget does not cover is the time one `intersectCubics` call spends. Its own caps
 * bound it, but a near-tangential pair - two curves of the same shape a hair apart, where a
 * fat-line clip cannot make progress and the search falls back to bisection - costs
 * thousands of times what an ordinary pair does, and a thousand curves mutually shadowing
 * each other therefore take seconds, most of it inside Stage 1.
 *
 * Nothing here logs: engine core has no logger. The one thing it throws is
 * `GeomLimitError`, and only where the alternative would be a confidently wrong answer.

 * resolve, and the pieces between the cuts were then decided by a coin toss. So the pieces
 * are compared as point sets: each is sampled and every sample projected onto the other,
 * both ways, because one piece can lie along part of the other without the reverse holding.
 * A measurement at six points a side, not a proof; a pair that crosses twice inside one
 * sample gap while staying within the weld radius is a shared run at the weld's resolution.
 *
 * ## The ends are NOT sampled, and that is a measured choice
 *
 * Sampling the ends as well makes the test stricter: a piece that overhangs another at one
 * end fails it, so neither is deleted as a duplicate. Which is right depends on the pair, and

 * t = 0 and t = 1 (and a third with twice as many interior points, which measured exactly as
 * the ends-included one did, so the density is not what decides it).
 *

 * - A fan of copies of one blob rotated about a point, 42 rows over two scales, three fan
 *   angles and seven copy counts: 0 wrong grid points with the interior only, 154 with the
 *   ends. The 154 is two rows, both at a fan step of 1e-8 with 30 copies, where including the
 *   ends leaves two contours where the shape has one.
 * - The CUTS family, which exists for exactly this question (the same boundary presented
 *   twice, cut at different parameters, at offsets that straddle the weld radius, the pieces
 *   deliberately of unequal length): 2,016 cases, 46 wrong with the interior only, 52 with
 *   the ends, and nothing wrong only in one of them.
 * - Thirty copies of one blob, exact and perturbed ten ways, self-unioned and stroked at
 *   scale 100: 2,222 wrong with the interior only, 2,299 with the ends, the difference being
 *   the same fan row.
 *
 * The case the ends were added for, a stroke of thirty jittered copies coming back as
 * fourteen contours, does not arise in this build: with the clip budget in place that row
 * gives two contours and no wrong points either way. If that case comes back, this is the

 * down to a 1e-9 box needs more levels than its depth cap allows - it reports nothing at
 * all for two circles that meet at a point. As an INTERSECTION answer that is defensible;
 * there is no crossing. As input to a boolean it is fatal, because a piece is only
 * classified correctly when its midpoint is somewhere the answer is unambiguous, and
 * immediately either side of an external tangency one disc is filled and the other is
 * not. A tangency landing at the midpoint of an arc therefore decides that arc at the one
 * parameter where the winding has no value, and the arc is deleted from both operands.
 *
 * Two steps, and the split between them is the whole design. Subdivision ISOLATES: a
 * sub-pair whose TIGHT boxes lie further apart than the weld radius provably contains no
 * contact and is discarded outright, so what survives is a proof of where a contact can
 * be, not a guess. Minimisation PINS: within a surviving bracket the contact is the
 * parameter where the gap between the curves is least, found by golden section on the
 * exact gap.
 *
 * Subdividing all the way down instead - the obvious single-step version - cannot locate a
 * tangency at all, and this is worth stating precisely because the failure looks like
 * rounding rather than like a wrong method. Two curves tangent to second order stay within
 * the weld radius over a parameter neighbourhood of √(weld/Δκ), which for a weld of 1e-5 on
 * page-sized arches is a fiftieth of the curve. Every box pair in that neighbourhood
 * qualifies, so the recursion reports a scatter of contacts spread across it, each one a
 * cut that misses the touch point by enough to leave a visible sliver - and it burns its
 * node budget subdividing a region it can never resolve. The gap MINIMUM is at the contact
 * and nowhere else, and because the gap is quadratic there it pins down to about the
 * square root of double precision: a contact located to ~1e-9 rather than to ~1e-2.
 *
 * A contact that turns out to sit on a curve's endpoint - two curves of one contour meeting
 * at their shared vertex, which is not an intersection at all - converges onto that
 * endpoint, where `addSplit` then correctly refuses to cut.

/**
 * Do two curves share a stretch of BOUNDARY over the bracket a scatter of hits spans, or
 * do they merely touch inside it?
 *
 * This cannot be decided by how wide the bracket is. A tangency is a double root, and the
 * solver reports it as two roots a whisker apart - but how wide a whisker depends on the
 * curvature difference at the contact and on the root polish, and for two circles meeting
 * at a point it comes out at 7.7e-6 against a weld radius of 4e-6. Comparing the bracket's
 * extent to the weld radius is therefore a magnitude race, and losing it is not a rounding
 * error: the contact is called an overlap, `overlapSplits` finds no endpoint of either curve
 * on the other and cuts nothing, the tangency stays interior to a piece, and that piece is
 * then classified at the one parameter where the winding has no value. Two tangent circles
 * came back with every operator wrong by a whole lobe.
 *
 * What distinguishes the two cases is not size but analytic continuation. Sharing boundary
 * means agreeing on an INTERVAL, and two cubics that agree on an interval are the same cubic
 * - the affine map between their parameters that holds on the bracket holds everywhere. So
 * the bracket is used only to FIND that map, and the agreement is then tested across the
 * whole of `ci`, at the parameters of `cj` the map sends it to. A shared run passes, because
 * the map really is exact and extending it costs nothing. A tangency fails by an enormous
 * margin: its bracket is a millionth of the curve, so the map magnifies by a million and
 * asks about `cj` far outside its own domain, where two curves that merely kissed have long
 * since parted. Returns 1 for the same direction, -1 for opposed, 0 for different curves.

/**
 * Decide overlapping material once.
 *
 * Where the two operands share a stretch of boundary there is no isolated crossing to
 * find, and the side test keeps BOTH copies whenever it keeps either - they describe
 * the same boundary from each path's point of view. So the survivors are matched up
 * afterwards by direction: two kept pieces running the same way are one edge and
 * collapse to a single copy (this is what makes a union keep one and an intersection
 * keep same-direction overlaps); two running opposite ways enclose nothing between them
 * and both go (which is what drops a shared edge from a difference and from an xor).
 *
 * ## Edges too short to have a direction
 *
 * The verdict above turns entirely on DIRECTION, and an edge shorter than the radius its
 * ends are known to has none. Both tests are run at the weld radius: `coincidence` asks
 * whether two edges agree to within it, and every endpoint in the edge set was placed by a
 * projection or a root solve that is only trustworthy to it. So for an edge whose whole
 * extent is a weld radius or two, "the same curve, running the other way" and "the same
 * curve, running the same way" are the same measurement, and the answer is whichever the
 * rounding fell out as. Such a pair is therefore left alone rather than resolved on a coin
 * toss.
 *
 * Leaving it alone is the safe way to be wrong, and the two directions are not symmetric
 * here. A duplicate weld-scale sliver that survives is a spur the walk steps over: it is
 * shorter than the radius `walkLoops` joins edges at, so both copies chain from and to the
 * same vertex and one of them is simply never taken. An annihilated sliver that was the only
 * link between a vertex and the rest of its curve is a BREAK, and the walk cannot step over
 * that: the chain dead-ends, everything past it is abandoned, and the abandoned part is not
 * a sliver - measured on a three-cubic self-crossing chain stroked at 4, deleting one
 * 1.0e-5-long edge cost an 87-unit lobe out of a 1047-unit outline and turned 3 contours
 * into 7. The lobe is not misplaced in that output, it is gone.
 *
 * This is the same trap `continuesAsSameCurve` was written for, in a different room: a
 * comparison at some tolerance says nothing about geometry the size of that tolerance, and
 * the way out is to notice when the evidence is vacuous rather than to tighten or loosen the
 * tolerance. The bar is two weld radii because an edge carries that uncertainty once at each
 * end; nothing here is being asked to resolve finer than the operands were given.
 *
 * The trace comparison is metered against the operation's own budget, which is what every
 * other projection in this file is metered against, and is skipped once that budget is
 * spent. It used to be handed a budget of its own with a work allowance of 1e9, so a path
 * with thousands of weld-scale edges could pay for unbounded sampling here after the rest of
 * the operation had been capped. Skipping it keeps a duplicate rather than deleting one,
 * which is the safe way to be wrong for the reasons above.
