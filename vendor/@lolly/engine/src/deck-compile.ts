/**
 * Compile a read source deck into Design's own authored values (plan 274
 * section 3.4, stage 5).
 *
 * This file holds TWO modes, side by side and sharing their leaf helpers. The
 * faithful one (`compileFaithful`, work package 0c) makes every slide a Design
 * frame at the same proportions and every object a box row at the same place: no
 * archetype fitting, no colour or font assignment, no master furniture, so the
 * fidelity question can be answered on its own. The renovate one
 * (`compileRenovated`, work package 5) seeds each frame from the design system's
 * slide master and assigns the plan's content to the seeded role slots; nothing
 * is ever laid at scaled source coordinates over the furniture.
 *
 * Five rules both modes follow without exception:
 *
 *   - An object whose fidelity is `unavailable`, or that names no bytes a mode
 *     could draw, becomes an authored PLACEHOLDER layer: a muted box with a label
 *     saying the content could not be read, its id listed in
 *     `placeholderLayerIds` and its object recorded as `unresolved` in the
 *     report. A placeholder is never described as a picture of the source, and
 *     an empty box is never reported as content that was carried over.
 *   - Every source object gets exactly one disposition in the report, which
 *     `finalizeReport` checks before the compile returns.
 *   - Lineage is written in both directions for every layer, so a person or an
 *     agent can move from a source object to what it became and back.
 *   - A role a person stated in the plan outranks a role the compile derived, and
 *     an object the plan never lists takes no slot from one it does: the reviewed
 *     answer wins the slot, whatever reading order says.
 *   - Every colour use and every font mapping in the plan produces exactly one
 *     report entry, including the ones that reached no layer. A decision that
 *     changed nothing is still a decision somebody made.
 *
 * The frame's own Design row leads its `layers` list. A Design document is one
 * flat list of box rows, the children point at their frame by id, and the frame
 * row is where a per-slide transition and the speaker notes are written, so the
 * list holds the frame first and its children after it in z-order.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no clock, no network, no filesystem, no randomness. The same
 * source and options produce byte-identical JSON on every host.

// ─── the renovate mode (plan 274 section 3.4) ────────────────────────────────
//
// The faithful mode above answers "did the content travel". This one answers the
// other half of the journey: the slide is rebuilt from the design system's own
// slide master, and the source content is assigned to the archetype's roles. The
// two modes share their helpers and their report, and nothing about the faithful
// path changes.
//
// The rules the mode follows, all of them from plan 274 section 3.4:
//
//   - The plan decides. A proposal nobody reviewed is applied only when the
//     caller asks for it (`applyUnreviewed`, and `applyNeedsAttention` for the
//     flagged ones), and the report says so; otherwise an unreviewed proposal to
//     remove or replace is compiled as keep.
//   - Content goes into a role slot the master seeded, never at scaled source
//     coordinates on top of the furniture. A kept object takes, in order: (a) the
//     archetype slot for its role; (b) a compatible slot on the same frame (a
//     second body text joins the body while the estimate allows, a note such as a
//     citation or a kept footer takes the master's footer, a caption or label
//     slot, or the body's last paragraph); (d) a continuation frame seeded from an
//     archetype that has the role; and (e) the tray, only when no archetype of the
//     master has a place for it, when the plan asked for the tray, past the
//     continuation bound, or for a kept mark with no free picture slot on its own
//     frame (a slide of its own would read as content), with the reason on the
//     report entry. A mark replaced by the design system's own is the master's
//     furniture, never surplus. Step (c), the
//     archetype that covers the slide's content, is the first pass's choice.
//   - Several kept pictures on one slide share its picture slot as a grid of up
//     to `MAX_GRID_PICTURES` (`pictureGrid`: equal cells, equal gutters, each
//     picture at its own aspect, reading order). The pictures past that go to
//     one continuation slide with a grid of its own, and past that to the tray,
//     so a slide of pictures never becomes one slide per picture.
//   - A text slot takes the archetype's type scale and ink, not the source's.
//   - Colour mappings reach what the master does not colour: kept shapes and
//     strokes, fills, and text set wholly in one chromatic colour. An image layer
//     is never recoloured, because a kept picture keeps its own colours.
//   - Every source object still gets exactly one disposition, and lineage is
//     still written both ways for every layer.
