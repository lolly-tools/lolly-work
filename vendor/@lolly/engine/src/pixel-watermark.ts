// ─── Lolly pixel watermark - block-DCT spread-spectrum ────────────────────────
//
// A second, much weaker provenance signal that lives IN THE PIXELS, so it
// survives what strips Lolly's C2PA credential: a screenshot, a re-save, a
// JPEG recompress, a resize, an EXIF strip. C2PA answers "is this file
// byte-for-byte what Lolly signed" (strong, dies to any container change).
// This answers only "did these pixels pass through Lolly's export at some
// point" (weak, but durable). It is a COMPLEMENT to C2PA, never a
// replacement: when a credential is intact, trust that; this is the fallback
// signal for when it isn't.
//
// Technique: classic spread-spectrum (Cox/Kilian/Leighton/Shamoon 1997). On the
// SAME 8×8 grid JPEG's own DCT uses, a fixed ±1 chip sequence is added to a set
// of mid-band luma coefficients of every block, scaled by a perceptual mask so
// busy blocks carry more and flat ones stay clean. Detection re-reads the luma,
// forward-DCTs each block, and correlates the mid-band against the chip. This
// sum runs over every block, so cropping/overlay/partial loss degrades the
// score gradually instead of destroying it. Presence-only (yes/no + score); no
// payload.
//
// SECURITY POSTURE - read `plans/30-lollys-own-synth.md`. This is
// security-through-obscurity: the chip key ships in this (public) source and in
// the on-device detector, so a motivated adversary who reads it can subtract the
// mark out cleanly. It is honest cover against CASUAL stripping / re-encoding,
// NOT a hardened defense - same framing as the self-signed on-device C2PA key.
//
// Pure + DOM-free (no dependency beyond a hand-rolled 8×8 DCT), mirroring the
// engine's other byte/pixel modules (tiff.ts, apng.ts). The shell owns pixel
// decode/encode; this owns the transform math on a raw RGBA buffer.
