/**
 * A compiled frame drawn as a plain SVG (plan 274 section 3.4, "preview and
 * Design share one geometry").
 *
 * The review needs a picture of a proposed slide before anything is exported, and
 * mounting a Design runtime per thumbnail is not that picture. This module draws
 * the SAME rows the compile wrote, at the same coordinates, so a preview and the
 * document Design opens agree by construction rather than by two implementations
 * staying in step.
 *
 * What it draws, and nothing else:
 *
 *   - a box row as a `rect` with its fill, stroke, corner radius and opacity, and a
 *     linear or radial `grad` as an SVG gradient over the fill, each stop keeping its
 *     own opacity, so a scrim over a picture previews as a scrim;
 *   - a path row as a `path`: its authored nodes (Design's own path value, each
 *     node a fraction of the row box) lowered to cubics at the row's size, with
 *     its fill, fill rule, stroke, caps, joins and dash, so a chart carried as
 *     shapes previews as the chart rather than as dark rectangles;
 *   - a posed row inside a `g` that turns and mirrors it about its own centre, in
 *     the order Design composes the two, so a rotated or mirrored object is not
 *     drawn square and the right way round;
 *   - an image row as an `image` whose href the caller supplies, with the
 *     `preserveAspectRatio` its `fit` asks for. A reference the caller cannot
 *     resolve is drawn as a muted box with a label, never as an empty gap;
 *   - a text row as `text` lines, wrapped by an average glyph width, in the row's
 *     family, size, weight, colour and alignment, inside the row's `pad` inset on
 *     every side (Design's own default of 8 px when the row states none), each
 *     line Design's own line box tall (`DESIGN_LINE_HEIGHT`), centred when the row
 *     states no vertical alignment, and clipped to its box, as Design clips it;
 *   - a placeholder layer as a hatched muted box with its label, so a placeholder
 *     can never be mistaken for a picture of the source;
 *   - a slot of the master that nothing filled (a text slot with no words, a
 *     picture slot with no picture) as a hatched box with a 1 px edge and no
 *     label, so an empty box reads as a box rather than as a hole in the slide;
 *   - nothing at all for a hidden row.
 *
 * Two options change what is drawn, and both leave every other drawing byte for
 * byte as it was:
 *
 *   - `detail: 'thumbnail'` is for a drawing shown at `longEdge` px or less. It
 *     leaves out path contours and rows smaller than a pixel at that size, writes
 *     path coordinates in whole units, draws a run of outlined glyphs (a chart's
 *     label that reached the compile as shapes) as one bar the width of the run,
 *     since its words cannot be read at that size and its outlines are most of the
 *     drawing's bytes, and draws placeholders flat, without their hatch or label.
 *   - `fonts.brand` on a frame the renovate compile wrote (one that names its
 *     slide master) sets every text in the design system's faces: a family the
 *     row states that is neither the brand face nor the mono face is drawn in the
 *     brand face (close-out 9.2). The guard is for rows the compile did not write
 *     that way, such as a compile stored by an older version. A faithful frame
 *     keeps the source's own families, since it is the before.
 *
 * Two promises the drawing keeps. Everything is XML-escaped, because a row's text
 * is document-controlled. And the result names no external resource of its own: no
 * stylesheet, no font file, no script. The one href in it is the one the caller
 * returned from `assetHref`, which is the caller's own choice.
 *
 * The wrap is an estimate, the same average-advance estimate the compile's fit pass
 * uses (`designTextFit`), for the same reason: an engine module has no font file and
 * no shaper. The two read one layout, so the words a preview clips are the words the
 * compile reports as cut. A preview drawn from it is a preview, not a proof of fit.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no clock, no network, no filesystem, no randomness.
