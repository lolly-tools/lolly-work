 * Exact Bézier geometry - booleans, offsetting, stroke outlining, authored-spline
 * lowering, simplification and hit testing. The engine's geometry kernel
 * (engine/src/geom/) behind a tool-facing surface, attached verbatim by every
 * shell (`host.geom = makeGeomApi()`), so web / Tauri / CLI can never drift.
 * Pure math: DOM-free, synchronous, no platform dependency - the same shape as
 * `host.color`. Optional/additive and NOT gated by a `capabilities` flag: a tool
 * feature-detects `host.geom` and degrades where it's absent (or raises its
 * manifest `engineVersion` floor to `">=1.64"` if it genuinely cannot).
 *
 * ## The currency is SVG path data
 *
 * Every path in and out of this API is a path-data **string** - the form a tool
 * already puts in a template, stores in state and packs into a URL. Nothing here
 * asks a tool to build flat control-point tuples. `parse` / `toPathData` expose
 * the structured form (whole cubics, 8 numbers each) for callers that want to
 * walk or edit the curves themselves; `d` in, `d` out is the normal path.
 *
 * ## Errors are RETURNED, not thrown
 *
 * Every method returns a discriminated result: `{ ok: true, … }` or
 * `{ ok: false, code, message }`. Two reasons, both about what a tool can do
 * with the answer:
 *
 * - Invalid path data is *ordinary* input here, not an exceptional condition. A
 *   `d` string can arrive from a paste, a URL param or a half-finished pen drag,
 *   and "that isn't a path" is a state the tool must render something for.
 * - A throw from `onInit`/`onInput` is caught and LOGGED by the runtime, then
 * discarded - the tool's inputs simply don't update and the user sees nothing.
 *   A pen tool that silently stopped responding mid-drag is the worst possible
 *   failure mode, so failure is made a value the hook has to look at.
 *
 * `code` keeps the distinctions the kernel makes; it never collapses them:
 *
 * - `'invalid-path'` - the path data is malformed (bad command, wrong argument
 *   count, unparseable number, a non-finite or absurd coordinate). Your input
 *   was wrong. Reject it; do not retry.
 * - `'too-large'` - well-formed but past the parse ceilings (see `limits()`):
 *   too many characters, commands or curves. Retryable with a smaller path.
 * - `'limit'` - the *operation* could not be answered within bounded work (the
 *   kernel's `GeomLimitError`). The input was fine and the answer exists; this
 *   engine declines to guess at it. Retryable with simpler operands, a coarser
 *   `tolerance`, or fewer paths at once.
 * - `'invalid-argument'` - a non-path argument is wrong (a NaN distance, an
 *   unknown join style, one path where two were needed).
 * - `'unsupported'` - a declared-but-unimplemented feature, e.g. a `spline`
 *   `kind` the running engine knows the name of but cannot lower yet.
 * - `'internal'` - an unexpected engine failure. A bug; report it.
 *
 * What no code means: a silently-wrong path. There is no degraded fallback
 * anywhere in this API - every method either returns geometry it stands behind
 * or tells you it didn't.
