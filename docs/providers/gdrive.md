# Google Drive (kind: `gdrive`)

Federate one Google Drive folder as a **read-only** catalog source. The app provides typed
configuration and browser consent using your own registered Google Cloud web application.
The [CLI consent flow](README.md#kinds-with-a-registered-consent-flow-dropbox-gdrive-o365)
remains available for advanced and config-managed sources.

## What you need from Google

- **A Google Cloud OAuth client** you register (APIs & Services → Credentials), with the
  **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`** scope and offline access (refresh
  token). Enable the Drive API on the project.
- **The folder id** - the trailing segment of the folder's Drive URL.
- BYOT: the client id/secret are yours; the app or `lw providers auth` captures the refresh token.

## Guided connection in the app

1. Open **Providers → Google Drive → Guided connection**. Enter a source id and label,
   the folder id, catalog type, refresh interval and member groups. Enter one exact group
   name per line; commas are part of the name. Empty groups allow all members.
2. Choose **Save disabled source**. Configuration is durable, but the source does not enter
   the catalog. An admin can save it and hand it to an owner using **Continue setup**.
3. In your Google Cloud project, enable the **Google Drive API**, configure the consent
   audience and create an OAuth client of type **Web application**. Register the **exact
   authorized redirect URI shown in the app**, including its scheme, host and port. It is
   `<instance origin>/api/auth/provider-oauth/callback`, separate from employee SSO.
   See Google's [web application registration and consent documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server).
4. As an owner, enter that client id and secret, then choose **Connect with Google**. Grant
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` using an account that can read the folder.
   The server captures an offline refresh token and seals it after checking the granted
   scope and selected folder. No OAuth JSON needs to be copied into the form.
5. Google returns you to the saved source. Choose **Test saved files and original**. Review
   file names, skipped records, sample limits, original byte count, MIME type and SHA-256.
   No source file or preview fragment is saved, and the stored credential is not returned.
6. Confirm the folder and member groups, then choose **Sync and enable source**. A failed
   sync or zero exposed files leaves it disabled. Settings or credential changes invalidate
   activation evidence; test the saved source again. A bounded sample is not a full inventory.
7. Finish the live verification below before accepting the customer installation.

Consent requires an owner browser session, `LW_CREDENTIAL_SECRET` and an HTTPS instance URL
(loopback HTTP is accepted for evaluation). The latest consent started in that browser
replaces any earlier pending consent; finish it within ten minutes in the same signed-in
session. Cancelling, missing offline permission or a failed exchange retains the prior
credential. **Continue setup** resumes a saved source after closing the panel or restarting
the server. Disable an enabled source before editing or reconnecting it. Config-managed or
advanced settings continue through their existing API/CLI contract.

For an organization-only Workspace app, configure the appropriate internal audience and
check its administrator controls. External apps in **Testing** issue Drive refresh tokens
that expire after **seven days**; use the applicable production consent/verification setup
before go-live. Publishing does not guarantee a token will never expire or be revoked.
See Google's [OAuth app states](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/production-readiness/overview)
and [refresh-token expiration rules](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration).
The app requests account-wide read-only Drive scope; its folder setting limits catalog
exposure, not Google's grant. Connect an account with suitably limited source access.

## Live verification before acceptance

- Put a known ordinary image or vector file directly in the curated folder. Compare the
  preview checksum and byte count with that original; folders and native Docs/Sheets/Slides
  are skipped. The preview reads at most five pages, 1,000 files and one 32 MiB original
  within 30 seconds; metadata/token responses are capped at 2 MiB.
- Enable only after reviewing the sample and full-sync counts. Sign in with a permitted
  member group, find the external file in the catalog and fetch its original. Repeat with a
  member outside the configured groups and confirm the asset and original are denied.
- Disable the source and confirm its catalog entries disappear and an earlier blob URL
  cannot serve. Reconnect and test a revoked grant to rehearse recovery.
- Record the source/account, folder, installed app version, group results, known-original
  checksum and consent audience/status. Run this against the actual customer Workspace:
  automated fixtures and browser rehearsal do not discharge live acceptance.

## Credential shape

The sealed OAuth JSON blob - captured by browser or CLI consent, not typed:

```json
{ "clientId": "…", "clientSecret": "…", "refreshToken": "…" }
```

```bash
lw providers auth acme-gdrive
```

## instance.json / `lw providers add`

```json
{
  "id": "acme-gdrive",
  "kind": "gdrive",
  "label": "Acme Google Drive",
  "options": { "folderId": "1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz" },
  "exposure": { "groups": ["design"] }
}
```

- `options.folderId` (required) - the federated folder's id from its Drive URL.

## Verify

```bash
lw providers auth acme-gdrive
lw providers health acme-gdrive
```

## Notes / limits

- One flat folder, including a shared drive folder. Subfolders are not walked and native
  Google documents are not converted. Shared-drive request flags follow Google's
  [shared drive API guidance](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/enable-shareddrives).
- No native approval status or availability dates; expose a curated folder of approved files.
- Download URLs are short-lived (`expiringUrls`) - fetched per request, streamed,
  host-pinned. Supports server-side search.
- Supports the **exit** (materialize → cutover). Does **not** accept published exports.
