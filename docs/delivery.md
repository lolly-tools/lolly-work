# Outbound delivery

Outbound delivery sends one finished Lolly export to a fixed destination owned by the
organization. Three open adapters cover object storage, sovereign file servers and a small
receiver protocol: generic S3-compatible storage (AWS S3, MinIO, Ceph RGW, Garage, UpCloud),
WebDAV (including Nextcloud/ownCloud), and HMAC-signed HTTPS.

This is not a writable catalog provider. Catalog providers federate remote assets **into**
Lolly, normally read-only; delivery sends a generated output **out**. Reusing the same
credential would silently upgrade read authority to write authority, so the two contracts,
registries and secrets stay separate.

## Freedom boundary

- Personal send targets stay on the person's device. Work cannot inspect, disable, redirect,
  credential, or select them.
- Organization destinations contain organization credentials on the server. A shell receives
  only `{id, kind, label, formats, maxBytes, visibility}` after group and RBAC filtering.
- Organization destinations cannot become a person's automatic export home.
- No destination is configured by default; absence means zero outbound delivery.
- A manual send is explicit. Automation may publish only its own completed, immutable render
  output by reference; it cannot nominate a personal file, another principal's job, or an
  arbitrary BlobStore key.
- The connected shell presents organization targets beside personal ones. An organization S3
  target cannot replace a person's S3 connection, and a person's connector preference cannot
  withdraw an organization target. Organization targets accept fresh exports only, never an
  arbitrary catalog asset, and the shell requests a Content Credential on the exact sent bytes.
- S3 is an open protocol adapter, not a privileged hosted service. A deploy brings its own
  endpoint, bucket and key and can leave without migrating a Lolly-specific representation.

`lolli.li` is the Lolly open-source project's release/model file host, **not a user-upload
service and not a built-in destination**. Its UpCloud bucket is used only by an explicitly
gated developer canary to verify S3 interoperability; the canary writes inert bytes under a
random technical key and deletes that exact key in `finally`.

## Configure a fixed S3 destination

```json
{
  "delivery": {
    "maxBytes": 67108864,
    "destinations": [
      {
        "id": "campaign-archive",
        "kind": "s3",
        "label": "Campaign archive",
        "credentialRef": "LW_DESTINATION_CAMPAIGN_ARCHIVE",
        "enabled": true,
        "groups": ["marketing", "brand"],
        "formats": ["svg", "png", "jpg", "pdf"],
        "maxBytes": 33554432,
        "options": {
          "bucket": "approved-output",
          "endpoint": "https://minio.example.org",
          "region": "us-east-1",
          "prefix": "campaigns"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Set the referenced secret in the deployment environment:

```bash
LW_DESTINATION_CAMPAIGN_ARCHIVE='<accessKeyId>:<secretAccessKey>'
```

Use a write key dedicated to this destination and restricted to the configured bucket/prefix.
Do not reuse the catalog-provider credential, the instance BlobStore credential, or an
operator's broad release key. `publicBaseUrl` is optional and means exactly what it says: when
present, Work marks the descriptor public and returns the corresponding object URL in the
receipt. An unguessable public URL is not access control.

## Configure a fixed WebDAV destination

The collection and any `prefix` subdirectory must already exist. Delivery neither browses the
account nor creates a folder tree; it can write only beneath the fixed collection URL.

```json
{
  "id": "team-files",
  "kind": "webdav",
  "label": "Approved team files",
  "credentialRef": "LW_DESTINATION_TEAM_FILES",
  "enabled": true,
  "groups": ["brand"],
  "formats": ["svg", "png", "pdf"],
  "options": {
    "url": "https://cloud.example/remote.php/dav/files/team/outgoing",
    "prefix": "approved"
  }
}
```

Set `LW_DESTINATION_TEAM_FILES='<username>:<app-password>'`, or use
`bearer:<token>` for a token-fronted DAV server. For Nextcloud, use a revocable app password,
not the account password. A deterministic flat filename makes a retry overwrite the same
resource; a successful `PUT` is followed by authenticated `HEAD` and bounded `GET` verification
of size and SHA-256 before the receipt claims byte preservation. `publicBaseUrl` is optional and
separate from the credentialed collection URL.

## Configure a signed-HTTPS destination

This is the adapter for an organization-owned publishing service without coupling Work to its
vendor or API. The target is one exact HTTPS endpoint, not a user-entered webhook:

```json
{
  "id": "press-publisher",
  "kind": "https",
  "label": "Press publisher",
  "credentialRef": "LW_DESTINATION_PRESS_PUBLISHER",
  "enabled": true,
  "groups": ["communications"],
  "formats": ["png", "jpg", "pdf"],
  "options": { "url": "https://publisher.example/lolly-delivery" }
}
```

Set the referenced variable to a dedicated random HMAC secret. Work sends the raw export body
with `x-lolly-delivery-id`, `x-lolly-format`, a base64url `x-lolly-name`,
`x-lolly-content-sha256`, `x-lolly-timestamp`, and
`x-lolly-signature: v1=<hex-hmac-sha256>`. The signed canonical string is:

```text
lolly-delivery-v1\n<timestamp>\n<delivery-id>\n<format>\n<base64url-name>\n<content-type>\n<size>\n<sha256>
```

The receiver should reject stale timestamps and duplicate delivery ids. It may return no body,
or JSON `{ "id": "…", "url": "https://…", "sha256": "…" }` (maximum 64 KiB). A matching
digest yields `transformation: "none"`; a different digest is recorded as
`"provider-managed"`; no digest stays honestly `"unknown"`. Work does not offer a revoke for
this protocol because it has no safe universal delete contract.

## Delivery lifecycle

The raw body is accepted only when it carries Lolly's C2PA export assertion. Before provider
egress, Work records its SHA-256 and stages the exact bytes in the configured BlobStore:

```text
awaiting-approval --approve--> queued -> delivering -> delivered
        |                               \-> failed -> retry -> delivering
        \--reject/withdraw--> rejected/cancelled
```

The record binds the destination version, name, format, MIME, size and SHA-256. Those facts are
immutable in both memory and Postgres stores. A retry uses the staged bytes and the same S3 key:

```text
<prefix>/<delivery-id>/<sha256-prefix>-<safe-filename>.<format>
```

If the destination's endpoint, bucket, prefix, formats, exposure or other semantics change,
the version changes and retry returns `409 DESTINATION_CHANGED`; the caller creates a new
delivery deliberately. Credential rotation does not move the version.

### Delivering an automation output

`POST /api/v1/jobs/:id/deliveries` consumes a completed `render` job owned by the same member or
service principal. The JSON body is `{ "destinationId": "campaign-archive", "name": "Launch
poster" }`; an optional `format` must equal the immutable render request rather than overriding
it. When the job completes, Work records SHA-256 over the actual output bytes independently of
the blob provider (an S3 ETag is not a portable content digest). Delivery reads the retained
result, verifies it against that digest, re-verifies its Lolly Content Credential, then points
the delivery's private `sourceRef` at that existing blob. There is no download/upload round trip
and no second stored copy. Jobs completed before digest storage was introduced must be rendered
again before this route can deliver them.

The delivery receipt exposes `sourceJobId` for correlation, never the private blob reference.
The source job cannot be deleted while any delivery retains its output (`409
JOB_OUTPUT_IN_USE`), including after successful egress, so retry and audit cannot be made false
by deleting their evidence. A later retention policy will release both deliberately. A service
token still cannot enter a destination's human approval chain; that boundary is identical for
raw-body and job-output creation.

### Optional human approval

Set `approvalChain` on a destination to an existing chain id. Creation then returns `202` with
`state: "awaiting-approval"` and an `approvalId`; no provider request has happened. The approval
subject is the delivery id, whose immutable record already binds destination version, name,
format, size and digest. A terminal approval runs that exact staged record. Rejection becomes
the terminal delivery state `rejected`, withdrawal becomes `cancelled`, and neither can be
relabelled as a transport failure or bypassed through the retry route. A configured chain that
does not exist fails closed before the request body is accepted. Service tokens cannot create
a human-review request; later workflow automation must enter through its own explicit approval
step rather than laundering a token as a person.

S3 `PUT` is followed by a signed `HEAD` size check; WebDAV performs authenticated
`PUT`/`HEAD`/bounded-`GET` digest verification. Their receipts record `transformation: "none"`
and the delivered digest. Signed
HTTPS derives that status from the receiver's digest instead of pretending every publisher is
byte-preserving. Redirects are refused by all three adapters.
Delivery creation and retry share the existing automation rate-limit bucket because each may
spend an organization-owned credential; read-only discovery and receipt history do not.

Delivery history is principal-scoped. Stored records and audit events contain destination ids
and output facts, never credentials. Removing a destination stops new sends and retries but
does not delete remote objects or erase historical receipts.

## API example

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'Cookie: lw_session=…' \
  -H 'Content-Type: image/png' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: campaign-42-poster-v1' \
  --data-binary @poster.png \
  'https://work.example/api/v1/destinations/campaign-archive/deliveries?name=Launch%20poster&format=png'
```

Discovery and history routes are listed in the [API reference](api.md#outbound-delivery).

## Current edge of the first slice

Built now: shell presentation separated from personal connections; optional approval-chain
binding over immutable staged bytes; completed automation-render output consumed by immutable
reference with principal isolation and delete protection; fixed config-managed S3,
WebDAV and signed-HTTPS targets; group/RBAC projection; C2PA and byte caps; durable records in
both stores; idempotency; exact-byte retry; provider receipts; and audit events. The S3 wire is
live-validated against the project's UpCloud host; WebDAV and HTTPS currently have injected-wire
tests and still need tenant/receiver canaries before either is called live-verified.

Still deliberately pending:

- the versioned small-workflow document/runner above the shipped job-output publish command;
- a replica-safe background claimant for queued/stalled deliveries;
- retention for staged retry bytes;
- administrator UI/CLI for destination configuration;
- live WebDAV and signed-HTTPS interoperability canaries against operator-supplied endpoints.

Those additions extend this record and adapter seam; they do not widen catalog providers or
the personal connected-services contract.
